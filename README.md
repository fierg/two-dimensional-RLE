A two dimensional RLE (run length encoding) implementation for one dimensional input data, e.g. Strings.

## TODO's
- [ ] Implement RLE for bitString
- [ ] Implement matrix representation and compression approach
- [ ] Create test data
- [ ] Create automated tests to compare filesize
- [ ] Evaluate the efficiency of possible implementations

### Usage
- Clone Project
- build Project and all dependencies with maven `mvn clean install`
- run Test with maven surefire plugin `mvn surefire-report:report` to execute all Test cases and get the results shown as a report in html.
