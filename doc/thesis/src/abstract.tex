\chapter*{Abstract}
%% ==============================
The paper reviews a combination of preprocessing methods applied to the coding scheme Run Length Encoding (RLE) and analyzes their effects to the compression ratio. It is shown that the implemented preprocessing steps enable RLE to achieve a reasonable compression on two corpora at an acceptable speed. Furthermore, the results are discussed in detail and the implementation is depicted.
