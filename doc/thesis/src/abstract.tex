\chapter*{Abstract}
%% ==============================
The paper reviews a combination of preprocessing methods, such as a Burrows-Wheeler-Transformation, applied to the coding scheme Run Length Encoding and analyzes their effects to the compression ratio. It is shown that the implemented preprocessing steps enable Run Length Encoding to achieve a reasonable compression on two corpora at an acceptable speed. Furthermore, the results are discussed in detail and the implementation is depicted.
