\section{Motivation}
%% ==============================
\label{ch:Introduction:sec:Motivation}
\par{
In the last decades, digital data transfer became available everywhere and to everyone. This rise of digital data urges the need for data compression techniques or improvements on existing ones. Run-length encoding \cite{rle-patent} (abbreviated as RLE) is a simple coding scheme that performs lossless data compression. RLE compression simply represents the consecutive, identical symbols of a string with a run, usually denoted by $\sigma^i$, where $\sigma$ is an alphabet symbol and $i$ is its number of repetitions. To give an example, the string aaaabbaaabbbba can be compressed into RLE format as  $ a^{4}b^{2}a^{3}b^{4}a^{1}$ . Thanks to its simplicity it is still beeing used in several areas like fax transmission, where RLE compression is combined with other techniques into Modified Huffman Coding \cite{fax-rle}. Most fax documents are typically simple texts on a white background, RLE compression is particularly suitable for fax and often achieves good compression ratios.

\section{Problem statement}
%% ==============================
\label{ch:Introduction:sec:Problem statement}
\par{
Some strings like aaaabbbb achieve a very good compression rate because the string only has two different characters and they repeat more than twice. Therefore it can be compressed to $a^4b^4$ so from 8 byte down to 4 bytes if you encode it properly. On the other hand, if the input is highly mixed characters with few or no repetitions at all like abababab, the run length encoding of the string is $a^1b^1c^1d^1e^1f^1g^hb^1i^1j^k$ which needs up to 16 bytes depending on the implementation. So the inherent problem with run length encoding is obviously the possible explosion in size, due to missing repetitions in the input string. Expanding the string to twice the original size is not really a good compression so one has to make sure the input data is fitted for RLE as compression scheme. One goal is to improve the compression ratio on data currently not suited for run length encoding and perform better than the originally proposed RLE, in order for it to work on arbitrary data. Another goal should be to minimize the increase in size in the worst case scenario.}

%% ==============================
\section{Main Objective}
%% ==============================
\label{ch:Introduction:sec:Main Objective}
\par{
The main objectives that derives from the problem statement is to achieve an improved compression ratio compared to regular run length encoding. To unify the measurements, the compression ratio is calculated by encoding all files listed in the Calgary corpus. Since most improvements like permutations on the input, for example a revertable Burros-Wheeler-Transformation to increase the number of consecutive symbols or a different way of reading the byte stream take quite some time, encoding speed will increase.
